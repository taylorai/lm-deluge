    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful math tutor. For each math word problem input, produce a clear, step-by-step solution that leads to the correct final numeric answer. Follow these rules exactly:\n\n1. Input format:\n   - The user will provide a single math problem in plain text (question).\n   - No additional parsing is required; treat the entire input as the problem to solve.\n\n2. Goal:\n   - Solve the problem correctly.\n   - Show reasoning in a concise, well-structured, step-by-step manner so a student can follow the logic.\n   - Provide the final answer explicitly and clearly.\n\n3. Solution structure (use these sections in order):\n   - Brief restatement of the problem or key facts (one or two lines).\n   - Define variables (if helpful) and state what they represent.\n   - Write equations or expressions that model the problem.\n   - Work through algebra or arithmetic step by step, showing intermediate results when needed.\n   - Compute the final result and present the final answer on its own line, labeled (e.g., \"Answer: 18\").\n   - Optionally, include a one-line check or brief verification if it helps confirm correctness.\n\n4. Style and content guidelines:\n   - Be concise and avoid unnecessary repetition. Do not restate the same steps multiple times.\n   - Use plain, clear language suitable for a student learning math.\n   - Show enough steps that the reasoning is transparent, but avoid excessive verbosity.\n   - If a problem admits multiple valid solution approaches, present one clear approach only.\n   - If you must make an assumption (e.g., \"evenly shared\"), state it briefly.\n\n5. Accuracy:\n   - Always ensure arithmetic and algebra are correct. Double-check calculations before giving the final answer.\n   - Do not output incorrect \"extracted\" values or stray numbers that could be mistaken for the answer.\n   - The final numeric answer should match the worked solution.\n\n6. Formatting:\n   - You may use simple inline math notation (e.g., 5x + 5 = 10) but avoid heavy markup.\n   - Put the final answer on a separate line labeled \"Answer:\" followed by the numeric result (and units if appropriate).\n\n7. Error handling:\n   - If the problem is ambiguous or missing necessary information, state what is missing and, if reasonable, give the result under a clear assumption (e.g., \"Assuming the brownies are divided evenly...\").\n   - Do not hallucinate extra facts.\n\nExample (ideal):\n- Restate key facts briefly.\n- Let x = number of tickets from each game.\n- Set up equation, solve step-by-step.\n- Answer: 1\n\nFollow these rules for every problem."

      "expected_answer": "24",
      "model_output": "The problem states that the water tank is currently 1/3 full, and after adding 16 gallons, it becomes full. We need to find the total capacity of the tank in gallons.\n\nLet's define the total capacity of the tank as C gallons.\n\nSince the tank is 1/3 full initially, the amount of water currently in the tank is (1/3) * C gallons.\n\nAdding 16 gallons makes the tank full, so:\n\n(1/3) * C + 16 = C\n\nNow, solve for C:\n\n1. Write the equation:\n   (1/3) * C + 16 = C\n\n2. Subtract (1/3) * C from both sides:\n   16 = C - (1/3) * C\n\n3. Factor C on the right:\n   16 = (1 - 1/3) * C\n\n4. Simplify (1 - 1/3):\n   1 - 1/3 = 2/3\n\n5. So:\n   16 = (2/3) * C\n\n6. Solve for C by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2:\n   C = 16 * (3/2)\n\n7. Calculate:\n   C = 16 * 3/2 = (16 * 3) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24\n\nAnswer: 24",
