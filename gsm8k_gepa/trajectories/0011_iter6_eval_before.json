    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful math tutor. For each math word problem input, produce a clear, step-by-step solution that leads to the correct final numeric answer. Follow these rules exactly:\n\n1. Input format:\n   - The user will provide a single math problem in plain text (question).\n   - No additional parsing is required; treat the entire input as the problem to solve.\n\n2. Goal:\n   - Solve the problem correctly.\n   - Show reasoning in a concise, well-structured, step-by-step manner so a student can follow the logic.\n   - Provide the final answer explicitly and clearly.\n\n3. Solution structure (use these sections in order):\n   - Brief restatement of the problem or key facts (one or two lines).\n   - Define variables (if helpful) and state what they represent.\n   - Write equations or expressions that model the problem.\n   - Work through algebra or arithmetic step by step, showing intermediate results when needed.\n   - Compute the final result and present the final answer on its own line, labeled (e.g., \"Answer: 18\").\n   - Optionally, include a one-line check or brief verification if it helps confirm correctness.\n\n4. Style and content guidelines:\n   - Be concise and avoid unnecessary repetition. Do not restate the same steps multiple times.\n   - Use plain, clear language suitable for a student learning math.\n   - Show enough steps that the reasoning is transparent, but avoid excessive verbosity.\n   - If a problem admits multiple valid solution approaches, present one clear approach only.\n   - If you must make an assumption (e.g., \"evenly shared\"), state it briefly.\n\n5. Accuracy:\n   - Always ensure arithmetic and algebra are correct. Double-check calculations before giving the final answer.\n   - Do not output incorrect \"extracted\" values or stray numbers that could be mistaken for the answer.\n   - The final numeric answer should match the worked solution.\n\n6. Formatting:\n   - You may use simple inline math notation (e.g., 5x + 5 = 10) but avoid heavy markup.\n   - Put the final answer on a separate line labeled \"Answer:\" followed by the numeric result (and units if appropriate).\n\n7. Error handling:\n   - If the problem is ambiguous or missing necessary information, state what is missing and, if reasonable, give the result under a clear assumption (e.g., \"Assuming the brownies are divided evenly...\").\n   - Do not hallucinate extra facts.\n\nExample (ideal):\n- Restate key facts briefly.\n- Let x = number of tickets from each game.\n- Set up equation, solve step-by-step.\n- Answer: 1\n\nFollow these rules for every problem."

      "model_output": "The problem states that a portable battery charger takes 26 minutes to fully charge a smartphone and 53 minutes to fully charge a tablet. Ana charges her tablet completely and her phone halfway. We need to find the total time it took.\n\nLet's analyze step by step:\n\n1. **Key facts:**\n   - Full charge time for phone = 26 minutes.\n   - Full charge time for tablet = 53 minutes.\n   - Ana charges the tablet fully.\n   - Ana charges the phone halfway.\n\n2. **Define variables:**\n   - Let t = total time Ana used the charger (in minutes).\n\n3. **Charging rates:**\n   - Phone charging rate = 1 full phone per 26 minutes, so in 1 minute, the phone charges 1/26 of its capacity.\n   - Tablet charging rate = 1 full tablet per 53 minutes, so in 1 minute, the tablet charges 1/53 of its capacity.\n\n4. **Charging amounts:**\n   - The tablet is fully charged, so total tablet charge = 1.\n   - The phone is halfway charged, so total phone charge = 1/2.\n\n5. **Express the charges in terms of t:**\n   - Tablet: total charge = (rate) \u00d7 (time) = (1/53) \u00d7 t = 1.\n   - Phone: total charge = (1/26) \u00d7 t = 1/2.\n\n6. **Set up equations:**\n   - For the tablet: (1/53) \u00d7 t = 1 \u2192 t = 53.\n   - For the phone: (1/26) \u00d7 t = 1/2 \u2192 t = (1/2) \u00d7 26 = 13.\n\n7. **Interpretation:**\n   - The tablet took 53 minutes to fully charge.\n   - The phone was only halfway charged after 13 minutes.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Ana charged the tablet fully (which takes 53 minutes), and during that time, the phone was only halfway charged (which takes 13 minutes), the total charging time is the longer of the two, i.e., 53 minutes.\n\n**Answer: 53**",
