We can break this down into steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of puzzles**:\n   - Each book has 30 puzzles.\n   - There are 15 books.\n   - Total puzzles = Number of books \u00d7 Puzzles per book\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total puzzles} = 15 \\text{ books} \\times 30 \\text{ puzzles/book} = 450 \\text{ puzzles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total time to find Waldo in all puzzles**:\n   - The average time to find Waldo in one puzzle is 3 minutes.\n   - Total time = Total puzzles \u00d7 Time per puzzle\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = 450 \\text{ puzzles} \\times 3 \\text{ minutes/puzzle} = 1350 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the total time into hours (if needed)**:\n   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n   - Total time in hours = Total time in minutes \u00f7 60\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time in hours} = \\frac{1350 \\text{ minutes}}{60} = 22.5 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time it would take to find every Waldo in all the puzzles is **1350 minutes** or **22.5 hours**.\n\nFinal numerical answer: **1350 minutes** (or **22.5 hours**).",

      "model_output": "To find the final price of the shirt after applying the profit margin and the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the selling price of the shirt:**\n   The store buys the shirt for $20 and adds a profit of 30%. To find the selling price, we first calculate 30% of $20.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 30\\% \\text{ of } 20 = 0.30 \\times 20 = 6\n   \\]\n\n   Now, we add the profit to the cost price to find the selling price:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Selling Price} = \\text{Cost Price} + \\text{Profit} = 20 + 6 = 26\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the sale price after the discount:**\n   The shirt is on sale for 50% off the selling price.
