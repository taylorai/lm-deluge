      "expected_answer": "13",
      "model_output": "To find the final price of the shirt after applying the profit margin and the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the selling price of the shirt:**\n   The store buys the shirt for $20 and adds a 30% profit. To find the selling price, we first calculate 30% of $20.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 30\\% \\text{ of } 20 = 0.30 \\times 20 = 6\n   \\]\n\n   Now, we add the profit to the cost price to find the selling price:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Selling Price} = \\text{Cost Price} + \\text{Profit} = 20 + 6 = 26\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the sale price after the discount:**\n   The shirt is on sale for 50% off the selling price. We need to calculate 50% of the selling price ($26).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount} = 50\\% \\text{ of } 26 = 0.50 \\times 26 = 13\n   \\]\n\n   Now, we subtract the discount from the selling price to find the sale price:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sale Price} = \\text{Selling Price} - \\text{Discount} = 26 - 13 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final answer:**\n   The final price of the shirt after the discount is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{13}\n   \\]",

      "question": "Mitzel spent 35% of her allowance. If she spent $14, how much money is left in her allowance?",
      "expected_answer": "26",
      "model_output": "To solve the problem step by step, we need to find out Mitzel's total allowance based on the information given.\n\n1. **Identify the percentage spent and the amount spent**: \n   Mitzel spent 35% of her allowance, which is equal to $14.\n\n2. **Set up the equation**: \n   Let \\( A \\) be Mitzel's total allowance. According to the problem, we can express the amount spent as:\n   \\[\n   0.35A = 14\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( A \\)**: \n   To find \\( A \\), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.35:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{14}{0.35}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate \\( A \\)**: \n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   A = 14 \\div 0.35 = 40\n   \\]\n   So, Mitzel's total allowance is $40.\n\n5. **Calculate the amount left in her allowance**: \n   To find out how much money is left after spending $14, we subtract the amount spent from the total allowance:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount left} = A - \\text{Amount spent} = 40 - 14\n   \\]\n\n6. **Perform the subtraction**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Amount left} = 40 - 14 = 26\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount of money left in Mitzel's allowance is **$26**.",
