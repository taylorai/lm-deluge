      "expected_answer": "18",
      "model_output": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the number of apples Phillip has**: \n   - Phillip has 40 apples.\n\n2. **Determine the number of apples Ben has**: \n   - According to the problem, Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip. \n   - So, we can calculate Ben's apples as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ben's apples} = \\text{Phillip's apples} + 8 = 40 + 8 = 48\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of apples Tom has**: \n   - The problem states that Tom has three eighths as many apples as Ben has. \n   - We can express this mathematically:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Tom's apples} = \\frac{3}{8} \\times \\text{Ben's apples} = \\frac{3}{8} \\times 48\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the multiplication**:\n   - First, calculate \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\times 48 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3 \\times 48}{8} = \\frac{144}{8} = 18\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final answer**:\n   - Therefore, Tom has 18 apples.\n\nSo, the final numerical answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]",

      "expected_answer": "1350",
      "model_output": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time it would take to find Waldo in all the puzzles across all the books. We can break this down into steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of puzzles**:\n   Each book has 30 puzzles, and there are 15 books. Therefore, the total number of puzzles is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total puzzles} = \\text{Number of books} \\times \\text{Puzzles per book} = 15 \\times 30\n   \\]\n\n   Calculating this:\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 30 = 450\n   \\]\n   So, there are 450 puzzles in total.\n\n2. **Calculate the total time to find Waldo in all puzzles**:\n   The average time to find Waldo in one puzzle is 3 minutes. To find the total time for all puzzles, we multiply the total number of puzzles by the time per puzzle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = \\text{Total puzzles} \\times \\text{Time per puzzle} = 450 \\times 3\n   \\]\n\n   Calculating this:\n   \\[\n   450 \\times 3 = 1350\n   \\]\n   So, it would take 1350 minutes to find Waldo in all the puzzles.\n\n3. **Convert the total time into hours (if needed)**:\n   To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time in hours} = \\frac{1350}{60}\n   \\]\n\n   Calculating this:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1350}{60} = 22.5\n   \\]\n   So, it would take 22.5 hours to find every Waldo.\n\n**Final Answer**: It would take 1350 minutes (or 22.5 hours) to find every Waldo.",
