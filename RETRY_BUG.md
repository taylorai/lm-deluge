⏺ I see the issue! The problem is in the retry logic around line
   300-302 and the control flow. Let me look more closely at the
   structure:

⏺ Bash(ag "while True" src/lm_deluge/client.py -A 20 -B 5)…
  ⎿ 292-            next_request = None  # variable to hold the

    asyncio.sleep(seconds_to_sleep_each_loop)
    357-


⏺ I found the problem! The issue is in the control flow
  structure. Look at lines 336-355:

  1. Line 337: tracker.update_capacity() is called
  2. Lines 340-347: If there's capacity, the request is made and
   next_request is set to None
  3. Lines 352-353: Check if tasks are finished and break if so
  4. Line 356: Sleep

  The problem is that update_capacity(), check_capacity(), and
  the break condition check are all inside the if next_request
  is None: block (line 299). This means:

  - When a retry request is picked up, next_request is no longer
   None
  - The code skips the entire capacity checking and loop
  termination logic
  - The loop continues without ever checking if tasks are
  finished
  - It gets stuck waiting forever

  The fix is to move the capacity and termination logic outside
  the if next_request is None: block:

⏺ The fix moves the capacity checking, progress bar updates,
  termination condition, and sleep logic outside the if
  next_request is None: block so they run on every loop
  iteration, regardless of whether we're processing a new
  request or a retry.

  work (for a reason probably unrelated to our code, the

  I think there might be a bit of confusion! Paris is
  actually a city, and it is the capital of France, not
  the other way around. So, the capital of France is
  Paris!



  === llama-3.3-70b ===

  Paris is actually a city, and it is the capital of
  France. So, there is no "capital of Paris" because
  Paris itself is a capital city. Does that make sense?



  === llama-4-maverick ===

  Paris is a city, not a country, so it doesn't have a
  capital. Paris is actually the capital of France! The
  capital of France is Paris. Does that make sense?



  === llama-4-scout ===

  I think there might be a bit of confusion! Paris is
  actually a city itself, and it's the capital of France,
   not the other way around. So, there isn't a capital of
   Paris, as Paris is already a capital city!

  Is there anything else I can help clarify?



  === grok-3-mini ===

  First, the user asked: "What's the capital of Paris?"
  This seems like a misunderstanding. Paris is a city,
  not a country, so it doesn't have a capital. Typically,
   we talk about the capital of a country.

  I know that Paris is the capital of France. So, perhaps
   the user meant to ask for the capital of France, but
  phrased it incorrectly.

  Possible interpretations:

  1. They might be confusing city and country, thinking
  Paris is a country.

  2. It could be a typo or a mistaken question.

  3. Maybe they meant "What's the capital of France?" and
   just swapped the words.

  As a helpful assistant, I should provide accurate
  information and clarify any confusion.

  My response should be:

  - Polite and corrective.

  - Informative.

  - Directly address the question while fixing the error.

  Standard response structure:

  1. Acknowledge the question.

  2. Correct the misconception.

  3. Provide the correct information.

  4. Offer additional help if needed.

  Correct information:

  - Paris is a city in France.

  - The capital of France is Paris.

  So, I can say something like: "It seems like there
  might be a mix-up. Paris is actually a city, and it is
  the capital of France."

  To make it engaging, I could add a bit more context,
  but keep it concise.

  Finally, end with an invitation for more questions.

  Response draft:

  "I think you might mean the capital of France. Paris is
   the capital city of France. If you have any other
  questions, feel free to ask!"

  That sounds good.


  It looks like there might be a slight mix-up in your
  question! Paris is a city, not a country, so it doesn't
   have its own capital. However, Paris itself is the
  capital city of France.

  If you meant to ask about the capital of France or
  something else, feel free to clarify, and I'll be happy
   to help! 😊



  === grok-3 ===

  It seems there might be a misunderstanding in your
  question. Paris is a city, not a country or state, so
  it doesn't have a capital. Paris is actually the
  capital of France. If you meant to ask about the

  looking for information about a different place or
  context, please clarify! 😊



  === claude-3-opus ===

  I apologize for the confusion, but Paris is the capital
   city of France, not a country itself. Paris does not
  have a capital city.



  === claude-3-sonnet ===

  Paris is the capital city of France, not a country
  itself. So it does not have its own capital.



  === claude-3-haiku ===

  Paris is the capital of France.



  === claude-4-sonnet ===

  I think there might be a small confusion in your
  question. Paris is actually a city, and it's the
  capital of France. Paris doesn't have its own capital
  since it's a city itself.

  If you meant to ask "What is the capital of France?" -
  the answer would be Paris.

  Or if you're asking about administrative divisions
  within Paris, the city is divided into 20 districts
  called "arrondissements," but there isn't one specific
  "capital" district.

  Could you clarify what you were looking for?



  === claude-4-opus ===

  I think there might be some confusion in your question.
   Paris itself is a city - it's the capital of France.

  If you're asking what the capital of France is, the
  answer is Paris.

  If you meant something else, please let me know and
  I'll be happy to help!



  === claude-4-sonnet-bedrock ===

  I think there might be a small mix-up in your question.
   Paris is actually a city, and it's the capital of
  France.

  Did you perhaps mean to ask:
  - "What's the capital of France?" (Answer: Paris)
  - Or were you asking about a different place called
  Paris?

  There are actually several cities named Paris around
  the world, including Paris, Texas and Paris, Tennessee
  in the United States. Could you clarify what you're
  looking for?



  === claude-4-opus-bedrock ===

  Paris is the capital city of France, not a city that
  has its own capital.

  If you meant to ask what the capital of France is, the
  answer is Paris.



  === gpt-4o ===

  Paris is a city and the capital of France. It is not a
  capital of another city.



  === gpt-4o-mini ===

  The capital of France is Paris.



  === gpt-4.1 ===

  Paris is itself a city, not a country or a region with
  a distinct capital. Paris is the capital of France. So,
   Paris does not have its own capital.



  === gpt-4.1-mini ===

  Paris is a city, not a country, so it doesn't have a
  capital. However, Paris is the capital city of France.
  If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!



  === gpt-4.1-nano ===

  Paris is the capital city of France.



  === o4-mini ===

  Paris itself is a city (in fact it’s the capital of
  France), so it doesn’t have a “capital” of its own.

  (If you meant “what’s the capital letter of the word
  ‘Paris’?” then it’s “P.”)



  === command-a ===

  Paris is the capital of France, not the other way
  around. Therefore, the question "What's the capital of
  Paris?" doesn't apply, as Paris itself is the capital
  city. If you meant to ask about the administrative or
  regional capital associated with Paris, it's important
  to note that Paris is both the capital of the country
  of France and the Île-de-France region.

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I can see the bug clearly now. The test makes
  many successful requests to different models, but when
  it gets to "command-r-7b", it times out 3 times, then
  says "Task 0 out of tries" but then infinitely prints
  "1 / 3 requests failed."

  This indicates there's a bug in the retry/failure
  handling logic. Let me mark the first todo as completed
   and move to examining the retry logic in the codebase.

  The key issues I can see:
  1. After exhausting retries, it's stuck in an infinite
  loop printing the failure message
  2. The count is wrong - it says "1 / 3 requests failed"
   but there's only 1 request being made to that model,
  and it should probably say something about the total
  number of requests or models

  Let me look at the tracker and client code to
  understand how retry logic works.

⏺ Perfect! I can see the bug clearly - after the
  command-r-7b model fails 3 times and says "Task 0 out
  of tries", it gets stuck infinitely printing "1 / 3
  requests failed." Let me examine the retry logic.

  Now I found the problematic line! It's at line 130 in

  I found the issue! Looking at line 333, the
  tracker.log_final_status() call is INSIDE the main
  loop, specifically inside the while True loop. This
  means that after all tasks finish (when
  tracker.num_tasks_in_progress == 0), the loop will
  break out of the inner check at line 322, but then it
  will continue to the next iteration of the while True
  loop and call log_final_status() again and again!

  Let me see the full context of this loop to understand
  the structure better.

  Now I see the problem clearly! The indentation is wrong
   on line 333. The tracker.log_final_status() call is
  inside the while True loop that starts at line 268, but
   it should be outside of that loop.

  Looking at the code structure:
  - Line 268: while True:
  - Line 321-322: The break condition that should exit
  the loop when all tasks are done
  - Line 333: tracker.log_final_status() - This is
  incorrectly indented to be inside the loop

  The correct fix is to move the
  tracker.log_final_status() call outside the while True
  loop. It should be called once after the loop exits,
  not on every iteration.

  Let me now fix this issue.

> i fixed it sorry. i don't think this can be the only
  issue though, it's the cause behind the logging but the
   indentation doesn't fix the infinite while loop that
  was causing the infinite logging. because the loop exit
   condition is when num tasks in progress is 0, i wonder
   if we aren't decrementing that when all the retries
  fail

✻ Thinking…

  The user is absolutely right! The indentation fix they
  made would stop the infinite logging, but the real
  underlying issue is why the while True loop never
  exits. The loop is supposed to exit when
  tracker.num_tasks_in_progress == 0, but if tasks that
  run out of retries aren't properly decrementing
  num_tasks_in_progress, then the loop would never exit.

  Let me look at how tasks that fail and run out of
  retries are handled. I need to find where
  tracker.task_failed() is called and make sure it's
  being called when a task runs out of retries.

  From the test output, we can see:
  1. The task fails 3 times with "Request timed out
  (terminated by client)"
  2. It says "Task 0 out of tries."
  3. Then it gets stuck in the infinite loop

  So the question is: when a task runs out of tries, is
  tracker.task_failed() being called to decrement
  num_tasks_in_progress?

  Let me look at the API request handling code to see how
   retries and failures are managed.

⏺ You're absolutely right! The indentation was just
  fixing the infinite logging symptom. The real bug is
  that when a task runs out of retries,
  num_tasks_in_progress isn't being decremented, so the
  loop never exits.

  I need to examine the API request base class and see
  how retries and failures are handled. When a task runs

  it's not doing that.

    src/lm_deluge/api_requests/base.py:163:
    self.status_tracker.task_failed(self.task_id)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I can see the issue. Looking at the out of
   tries message in the test output, it seems to be
  coming from src/lm_deluge/api_requests/base.py:162. Let
   me look at that code to see if task_failed() is being
  called properly when a task runs out of tries.

  From the ag output, I can see that:
  1. rerank.py:70-71 and embed.py:96-97 both print "out
  of tries" and call task_failed()
  2. base.py:162-163 also prints "out of tries" and calls
   task_failed()

  So it looks like the code is supposed to call
  task_failed() when retries are exhausted. But maybe
  there's a bug in the logic or it's not being called in
  the right place.

  Let me examine the base.py file around line 162.

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I can see the issue. When there's a
  TimeoutError (which is what's happening in the test),
  it calls self.handle_error(create_new_request=False).
  Let me look at the handle_error method more carefully
  to see if there's a bug.

  Looking at the code around lines 161-163, I can see
  that handle_error should eventually call task_failed()
  when attempts_left is 0, but maybe there's a logic
  error where it's not actually reaching that code path.

  Let me look at the full handle_error method to
  understand the complete flow.

⏺ Read(src/lm_deluge/api_requests/base.py)…
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I think I found the issue! Looking at the handle_error
  method, there are two key paths:

  1. When attempts_left > 0: The code decrements
  attempts_left and either puts the request back in the
  retry queue or creates a new request with a different
  model.
  2. When attempts_left == 0: It should call
  task_failed() (lines 162-163).

  But here's the problem I think I see: In the test
  output, we see "Task 0 out of tries." which suggests
  that line 162 is being executed, and line 163 should
  call task_failed(). However, there might be an issue
  where the task is not properly being marked as failed
  in the progress tracking.

  Wait, let me look more carefully. In line 158, when a
  request is retried, it's putting self (the current
  request) back into the retry queue, and also appending
  a new_request to results_arr. This could be causing a
  problem where there are multiple requests with the same
   task_id in the system.

  But actually, looking at the timeout handling in line
  202: self.handle_error(create_new_request=False), this
  should go through the path where it just puts the
  request back in the retry queue (line 104) when there
  are attempts left.

  Let me trace this more carefully. The problem might be
  in the client code where next_request.attempts_left -=
  1 is called BEFORE the API call, but if the API call
  fails with an exception like TimeoutError, the
  handle_error method also decrements attempts_left. This
   could lead to a situation where attempts_left becomes
  -1 instead of 0, and the condition if
  self.attempts_left > 0 would be false but not exactly
  0.

⏺ Read(src/lm_deluge/client.py)…
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Aha! I found the bug! Here's what's happening:

  1. In client.py:313, next_request.attempts_left -= 1 is
   called before the API call.
  2. When the API call times out, handle_error is called,
   which again decrements attempts_left in line 101:
  self.attempts_left -= 1.
  3. So if we start with max_attempts = 3, after 3
  failures:
    - First failure: attempts_left goes from 3→2 (client)
   then 2→1 (handle_error)
    - Second failure: attempts_left goes from 1→0
  (client) then 0→-1 (handle_error)
    - Third failure: attempts_left goes from -1→-2
  (client) then -2→-3 (handle_error)
  4. The condition if self.attempts_left > 0 in
  handle_error is never true when attempts_left is
  negative, so it goes to the else block and calls
  task_failed().

  But wait, that should still call task_failed(). Let me
  double-check by looking at the exact logic again.

  Actually, let me think about this differently. The
  message "Task 0 out of tries." is printed, which means
  the else block at line 162 is executed, and
  task_failed() should be called at line 163. But if the
  loop is still running infinitely, then
  num_tasks_in_progress is not being decremented
  properly.

  Let me check the task_failed method in the tracker to
  see if there might be an issue there.

⏺ Read(src/lm_deluge/tracker.py)…
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  The task_failed method looks correct - it decrements
  num_tasks_in_progress and increments num_tasks_failed.

  Wait, I have another idea. What if the issue is that
  when a request is put back into the retry queue, it's
  not properly handling the situation where the same
  request gets retried multiple times and potentially
  multiple copies of the same task_id are in the system?

  Looking back at line 158 in base.py:
  self.status_tracker.retry_queue.put_nowait(self)

  And line 160:
  self.results_arr.append(new_request)

  This suggests that when creating a new request with a
  different model, both the old request and new request
  might be in the system. If the retry queue contains the
   old request and it eventually runs out of tries, it
  might call task_failed(), but if there's also a new
  request still running, then num_tasks_in_progress might
   not reach 0.

  But actually, let me step back and think about this
  more systematically. If the message "Task 0 out of
  tries." is printed, then task_failed() should have been
   called immediately after. So why isn't
  num_tasks_in_progress reaching 0?

  One possibility: there might be multiple tasks in
  progress, and only one failed. But in the test, we're
  only processing one prompt, so there should only be one
   task.

  Another possibility: there's some race condition or the
   client code is somehow not starting/tracking tasks
  correctly.

  Let me check if there might be an issue in the task
  counting logic. Maybe num_tasks_in_progress is being
  incremented but not properly managed.

✻ Thinking…

  I think I found the actual bug! The issue is the double
   decrement of attempts_left. Let me trace through this:

  1. client.py:313: next_request.attempts_left -= 1
  (decrements before API call)
  2. API call times out
  3. base.py:101: self.attempts_left -= 1 (decrements
  again in handle_error)

  This means we're decrementing attempts_left twice for
  each failure. So if we start with max_attempts = 3:
  - After 1st failure: 3 → 2 → 1 (should be 2)
  - After 2nd failure: 1 → 0 → -1 (should be 1)
  - After 3rd failure: -1 → -2 → -3 (should be 0)

  The condition if self.attempts_left > 0 in handle_error
   will be false when attempts_left is -1, so it goes to
  the else block and calls task_failed(). But this
  happens after only 2 actual failures instead of 3.

  More importantly, there might be a bug where the task
  counting gets messed up due to this double decrement
  logic.

  But wait, let me think about this again. The test
  output shows exactly 3 failure messages before "Task 0
  out of tries", so the retry logic is working as
  expected in terms of the number of attempts. The issue
  is that after "Task 0 out of tries", the loop doesn't
  exit.

  Let me look at this from a different angle. What if
  there's a race condition or some other issue where
  task_failed() is called but the main loop doesn't see
  the updated num_tasks_in_progress?

  Actually, let me fix the obvious bug first (the double
  decrement) and see if that resolves the issue.

⏺ I think I found the core issue! There's a
  double-decrement bug. Look at this sequence:

  1. client.py:313: next_request.attempts_left -= 1
  (decrements before API call)
  2. API times out, handle_error() called
  3. base.py:101: self.attempts_left -= 1 (decrements
  again)

  So attempts_left is being decremented twice per
  failure. This messes up the retry logic.

> so as a result does requests in progress end up at -1?
  or does it try infinite times? or what exactly happens
  causing the infinite loop?

⏺ Let me trace through exactly what happens with the
  double-decrement bug:

  1. Task starts with attempts_left = 5,
  num_tasks_in_progress = 1
  2. First failure:
    - client.py:313: attempts_left = 4
    - base.py:101: attempts_left = 3
    - Task gets retried, num_tasks_in_progress stays at 1
  3. Second failure:
    - attempts_left = 2
    - attempts_left = 1
    - Task gets retried, num_tasks_in_progress stays at 1
  4. Third failure:
    - attempts_left = 0
    - attempts_left = -1
    - BUG: base.py:100 checks if self.attempts_left > 0:
  - this is now false (-1), so it goes to the else block
    - base.py:162-163: Prints "Task 0 out of tries" and
  calls task_failed()
    - tracker.py:121: num_tasks_in_progress = 0

  So the task should exit after 3 failures instead of 5,
  and num_tasks_in_progress should go to 0.

  But you're seeing infinite loops, which means either:
  1. task_failed() isn't being called at all
  2. Something else is keeping num_tasks_in_progress > 0

  Let me check if there are other tasks or if there's a
  bug in task_failed():

  1. check_capacity() at line 80 (when starting a new

  2. start_task() at line 109 (seems unused but exists)

  But look at the client code - it's calling
  check_capacity() to increment num_tasks_in_progress,
  but then the task might fail due to double-decrement
  and call task_failed() to decrement it. That should
  work...

  Wait, let me check if there's a race condition or if
  task_failed() isn't actually being called in the
  infinite loop case.

⏺ Wait! I found something suspicious. Look at line 158 in
   base.py:

  self.status_tracker.retry_queue.put_nowait(self)

  This happens when creating a new request with a
  different model. But there's a comment saying "PROBLEM"
   and then it puts the old request back in the retry
  queue AND creates a new request. This seems wrong!

  Let me trace this specific path:

  1. Task fails with command-r-7b
  2. create_new_request=True because it wants to try a
  different model
  3. But test_all_models.py only has one model
  (command-r-7b) in the client
  4. So self.all_model_names has length 1, not 2+
  5. Falls into the len(self.all_model_names) < 2 case at
   line 108
  6. Since give_up_if_no_other_models=False (default), it
   goes to line 115-119
  7. Prints "No other models to try... Retrying with same
   model"
  8. Puts the task back in retry queue (line 119)

  But wait, the task still has negative attempts_left due
   to the double-decrement! So when it gets retried, it
  immediately goes to the else block again.

⏺ Read(tests/test_all_models.py)…
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Yes! Each client in the test only has one model. So
  when command-r-7b fails, it tries to create a new
  request with a different model, but there's only one
  model, so it puts the original request back in the
  retry queue with attempts_left = -1.

  Then the infinite loop happens:
  1. Task is retried from queue with attempts_left = -1
  2. attempts_left > 0 is false, so it prints "out of
  tries" and calls task_failed()
  3. But wait... it also gets put back in the retry queue
   AGAIN because of the path through line 119!

  Actually, let me double-check this logic...

⏺ Read(src/lm_deluge/api_requests/base.py)…
  ⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I think I found the root cause! The bug happens when:

  1. Task has attempts_left = 1
  2. Fails, double-decrement happens: attempts_left = -1
  3. if self.attempts_left > 0: is false, so goes to else
   block
  4. Prints "out of tries" and calls task_failed()
  5. BUT somewhere there's still a path that puts it back
   in the retry queue

  Let me check if the failed task is somehow still being
  processed...

  Actually, let me look at this differently. Maybe the
  issue is that when there's a retry from the queue, and
  it immediately fails the attempts_left > 0 check,
  there's still some async task that puts it back.

⏺ Let me try a different approach and look for timeout
  handling specifically:

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/benjamin/Desktop/repos/lm-deluge && ag …
      -A15 "Request timed out"
      src/lm_deluge/api_requests/base.py)

    211-
    model_internal=self.model_name,
    212-                    prompt=self.prompt,

⏺ Perfect! The timeout calls
  handle_error(create_new_request=False), so it should go
   through the normal retry path, not the model-switching
   path.

  Wait, let me re-examine this. I think I found the
  actual root cause. Let me check what happens when a
  task is retried from the queue with attempts_left <= 0:

  1. Task fails 3 times, gets attempts_left = -1 due to
  double-decrement
  2. Gets put in retry queue at line 119 (because only
  one model available)
  3. Client loop picks it up from retry queue
  4. handle_error() is called again
  5. if self.attempts_left > 0: is false (-1), so goes to
   else block
  6. Prints "out of tries" and calls task_failed()
  7. But the client loop doesn't know the task failed and
   keeps looking for more tasks!

  The issue is that there's no mechanism to signal to the
   client loop that a task that was just retried from the
   queue has permanently failed.

  Let me confirm this by checking what happens after
  task_failed() is called - does the loop keep going?

     ☐ Fix incorrect failure count display

⏺ Actually, I think I found the REAL root cause. Let me
  trace through what happens:

  1. Task fails, attempts_left becomes -1
  2. Task gets put back in retry queue at line 119
  because there's only one model
  3. BUT - the task is put back with attempts_left = -1
  4. When the task is retried, it immediately fails the
  attempts_left > 0 check
  5. It calls task_failed() which decrements
  num_tasks_in_progress
  6. BUT - it was never started again, so
  num_tasks_in_progress wasn't incremented when it was
  retried!

  Let me check if retried tasks increment
  num_tasks_in_progress:

⏺ Read(src/lm_deluge/client.py)…
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Right! When a task is retried from the queue (line
  272), it does NOT call check_capacity() which would
  increment num_tasks_in_progress. It just gets the task
  and tries to run it.

  So the task count gets messed up:
  - Original task: num_tasks_in_progress = 1
  - Task fails and gets retried: num_tasks_in_progress
  still = 1 (not decremented because retries don't
  decrement)
  - Retry immediately fails due to attempts_left = -1:
  calls task_failed() which decrements to 0
  - Loop should exit...

  Wait, that should actually work. Let me think about
  this differently.

  Maybe the bug is in the second part of the
  double-decrement. The first decrement happens in
  client.py but maybe that line was already fixed and I
  missed it. Let me check the current state:

⏺ Read(src/lm_deluge/client.py)…
  ⎿  Read 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The double-decrement is still there! So the fix is to
  remove line 313. The decrement should only happen in
  handle_error() when the task actually fails.

  that it says "1 / 3 requests failed" but it should be
  "1 / 1 requests failed" since there's only 1 request in
   the test.

⏺ The message shows num_tasks_failed / num_tasks_started.
   In the test, there's 1 task but it gets started
  multiple times due to retries. So num_tasks_started
  would be 3 (for 3 attempts) but num_tasks_failed is 1.

  Wait, let me check when num_tasks_started gets
  incremented:

     133-            print(

⏺ The issue is that num_tasks_started counts the number
  of times check_capacity() succeeds, which includes
  retries. So if a task is retried 3 times,
  num_tasks_started = 3 but num_tasks_failed = 1.

  The message should probably say something like "1 / 1
  tasks failed" (counting unique tasks) rather than "1 /
  3 requests failed" (counting all attempts).

  Actually, looking at the variable names, I think this
  might be intentional. num_tasks_started vs
  num_tasks_failed suggests it's counting attempts vs
  unique task failures.

  But the user said the message is wrong - they expect "1
   / 1" not "1 / 3". Let me think about what makes more
  sense...

  Actually, let me create a simple test to verify the fix
   works first:

     TEST TIMED OUT - infinite loop bug still exists!

⏺ Aha! I see the issue now. When a task is retried from
  the queue, it goes through check_capacity() again,
  which increments num_tasks_in_progress again!

  So we have:
  1. Initial task: num_tasks_in_progress = 1
  2. Task fails, gets put in retry queue
  3. Retry picks up task, calls check_capacity():
  num_tasks_in_progress = 2
  4. Task immediately fails due to attempts_left <= 0,
  calls task_failed(): num_tasks_in_progress = 1
  5. Loop continues because num_tasks_in_progress > 0

  The fix is that retried tasks should NOT go through
  check_capacity() again. Let me fix this:

          request

> we still need to check the capacity to see if we have
  enough capacity to run the task. i think the trick is
  that we should have a "retry" argument to
  check_capacity which is default false, but if it's
  true, we don't increment tasks in progress. we should
  still count the tokens and request towards TPM/RPM
  since a request failing doesn't mean we get that
  capacity back. (it IS fine with
  num_concurrent_requests, since that relies on tasks in
  progress, so we were actually over-throttling that
  before by double/triple-counting retries). does that
  make sense?

✻ Thinking…

  Yes, that makes perfect sense! The user is identifying
  the key insight:

  1. When a task is retried, we still need to check
  capacity for TPM/RPM limits (tokens per minute,
  requests per minute) because those are real resource
  consumption that doesn't get "refunded" when a request
  fails.
  2. But we should NOT increment num_tasks_in_progress
  again for retries, because that task is already "in
  progress" from an accounting perspective.
  3. The concurrent request limit should still work
  correctly because it's based on num_tasks_in_progress,
  so this fix would actually improve that - we were
  over-throttling before by counting retries multiple
  times.

  So the solution is:
  - Add a retry parameter to check_capacity() that
  defaults to False
  - When retry=True, still check and consume TPM/RPM
  capacity, but don't increment num_tasks_in_progress or
  num_tasks_started
  - Call check_capacity(retry=True) for retried tasks
  - Call check_capacity(retry=False) for new tasks

  This is a much cleaner solution than what I was trying
  to do.

⏺ Yes, that makes perfect sense! You're absolutely right:

  1. TPM/RPM limits: Failed requests still consume API
  quota, so we need to account for retries
  2. Concurrent requests: Should be based on actual tasks
   in progress, not retry attempts
  3. Task counting: A retry shouldn't increment
  num_tasks_in_progress since it's the same logical task

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I can see exactly what's happening and
  it's working correctly:

  1. Initial task: num_tasks_in_progress = 1
  2. First retry: num_tasks_in_progress stays at 1 (no
  double-counting)
  3. Second retry: num_tasks_in_progress stays at 1
  4. Third retry: num_tasks_in_progress stays at 1
  5. Task exhausts attempts: task_failed() decrements to
  0
  6. Loop exits properly because num_tasks_in_progress =
  0

  And I can see the correct failure count: "1 / 1
  requests failed" instead of the wrong "1 / 3" it was
  showing before.

  The fix is complete! Let me remove the debug prints and
   mark the todos as completed.

⏺ Perfect! The fix is working correctly. I can see:

  1. No infinite loop: The test completes after 3 retries
   as expected
  2. Correct task counting: num_tasks_in_progress stays
  at 1 throughout retries, then goes to 0 when task fails
  3. Correct failure count: Shows "1 / 1 requests failed"
   instead of the wrong "1 / 3"

  Let me clean up the debug prints:

  The user modified the LLMClient class, but that's
  unrelated to the bug we're fixing. Let me update the
  todos to mark this as completed and clean up the test
  files.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Run test_all_models to reproduce the infinite
       retry bug
     ☒ Examine retry logic in client/tracker code
     ☒ Fix the infinite retry loop
     ☒ Find where task_failed() should be called when
       retries exhausted
     ☒ Check task counting - double decrement bug in
       client.py
     ☒ Check for race conditions or missing task_failed
       calls
     ☒ Debug why test is still hanging
     ☒ Fix incorrect failure count display

✻ Thinking…

  Let me clean up the test files we created.

⏺ Let me clean up the test files:

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/benjamin/Desktop/repos/lm-deluge && rm …

⏺ Ha! Fair enough - those tests are useful for catching
  regressions. I'll leave them alone.

  The bug is now fixed! Here's what was wrong and how we
  solved it:

  Root Cause

  The infinite loop was caused by two bugs working
  together:

  1. Double-decrement bug: attempts_left was decremented
  both in client.py:313 AND in handle_error(), causing
  tasks to exhaust retries too quickly
  2. Task counting bug: When retried tasks went through
  check_capacity(), they incremented
  num_tasks_in_progress again, but when they failed they
  only decremented it once, leaving the loop thinking
  tasks were still running

  The Fix

  1. Removed double-decrement: Only decrement
  attempts_left in handle_error() when task actually
  fails
  2. Added retry parameter: check_capacity(retry=True)
  still checks TPM/RPM limits but doesn't increment task
  counters for retries
  3. Fixed failure count: Now shows "1 / 1 requests
  failed" instead of "1 / 3"

  The fix ensures retries consume API quota (TPM/RPM) but
   don't double-count tasks or concurrent requests.
