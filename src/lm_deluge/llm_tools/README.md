# LLM Tools

The "tools" in this repo are not like the other Tools in this project. Rather than tools FOR LLMs, these are tools built WITH LLMs. These are like templates or helpful prompts that I found myself reaching for over and over again, that I thought may as well be crystallized into something re-usable.
